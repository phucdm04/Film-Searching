The mother is a schemer who, reduced to her last penny, is pulling every wire to induce wealthy young Dr. Ballard to marry Eloise. It looks as if she is going to succeed and the need for success is imperative because Mr. Evringham is set against his female dependents, whom he might expel from his home at any moment. Then word comes from another son, Harry Evringham, who writes that he and his wife must make a business trip abroad and he asks his father to take Jewel, the child he has never seen, into his home until they return in six weeks. Old Mr. Evringham reluctantly agrees to his son's request. He hates children and is gruff, unresponsive, and self-centered. The only reason he agrees to take the child is because his daughter-in-law, the widow, tries to get him to refuse. He hates this daughter-in-law; therefore takes Jewel in to spite her. Upon her arrival, Jewel meets with a very cool reception. She finds that, according to the Christian Science teachings with which she is familiar, that she has entered a household of hatred and discord. She puts the scriptures and Mrs. Eddy's teachings to practical use and proves to all scoffers that she has found and can demonstrate the truth. Jewel takes a strong liking to her bluff, stern, old grandfather and he finds his heart softening under her influence. She cures herself of a fever which she says came o because a shadow of hatred passed over her for the house's inmates. She wins the heart of the grim housekeeper when she redeems her drunkard son from the grip of the liquor demon, she converts Eloise to the truth of Divine Science, and she proves to everyone that Science can win in spite of all. She reaps a harvest of good from a bleak, barren soil, uniting the strained and jarring household by chain after chain of love.\n",

The nobleman is killed in an auto accident, and Billy then learns the real reason for the girl's buying her way into society. Lord Sheldon was her father. Circumstances connected with her mother's lowly birth had kept father and daughter apart. A desire to know the truth about her father's reputation prompted Phyllis to act as she did.

One night, at a gay party, Naomi's effervescent spirits deceive one of the men into thinking that she is far more unconventional than she herself has any idea of being. His companions tell him that she is not the sort of girl he thinks she is, but he insists that he can prove that she is; he even makes a wager to that effect. He tricks Naomi, who is really quite unsophisticated, accompanying him to a hotel of questionable repute, where the two, innocent of any wrongdoing, are captured in a police raid, and Naomi has an unpleasant experience in the night court. Friends come to her aid and she is released. Not long after this, Frederic Harmon, a broker, comes into her life. The two fall in love and are married; the birth of a baby completes Naomi's character and she cares only for her child, her husband, and her home. The husband, however, does not settle down to home life. He is still much inclined to the gaieties of the set in which he had become acquainted with Naomi, and when she refuses to take further part in the revels of the Bohemian crowd, he goes forth by himself and soon meets Helen Carew, a woman with a past and without a conscience, who fascinates him partly for her amusement and partly for mercenary reasons. Eventually Harmon's infatuation for the other woman becomes known to Naomi. She is heartbroken, particularly when Harmon asks her to divorce him so he can marry Helen. This she refuses to do. Helen, anxious to get the man entirely into her clutches, enters into a plot with a crooked detective whereby Naomi is to be caught in a compromising situation, thus giving her husband grounds for divorce from her. The detective picks up a convict just out of Sing Sing and by means of a decoy message Naomi is induced to go to a hotel room where the man from Sing Sing is waiting for her. Once the two are in the room together it is raided by newspaper reporters and a photographer, and a flashlight of Naomi in the arms of the convict is obtained. The husband brings suit for divorce, offering as evidence the stories of the witnesses at the raid and the flashlight photograph. He also asks custody of the child. Naomi startles the judge and spectators when she declares that she should be allowed to keep the child, because Harmon is not its father. The judge, however, suspects that Naomi is sacrificing her reputation in order to keep her baby, and calling her into his private office, he gets the truth from her. Meantime there has been an unexpected development in the affairs of Helen. The man from Sing Sing had been her lover before he went to prison, and she is unpleasantly surprised when the detective's use of him brings him again into her life. The ex-convict is in Helen's rooms, trying to renew their old association when Harmon comes to see her. Helen hastily hides the jailbird, but while she is talking to Harmon the convict comes out and tells Harmon of the woman's past and his connection with it. Horrified at the revelation of Helen's true character, Harmon goes out of her life at once and forever, but in the course of time succeeds in winning his way back into his home.\n",

In the courts Robert has been granted a decree of divorce and the custody of little Gail, upon evidence that Mrs. Collingwood has been found in a compromising situation with Henry Thorne, and her subsequent admissions. Once free, Mrs. Collingwood openly accepts the attention of Thorne, and they soon marry and go west to live. Thorne takes up the life of a prospector in a mining community, and his consistent failure proves a source of discouragement to him and unhappiness to the woman. Collingwood, his mind upset by domestic troubles, loses his fortune in Wall Street manipulation, and becomes a raving maniac. He drives his employees out of the office, and then goes to his home intending to kill his little daughter. In a chase up a staircase, he falls and is killed. An annuity he had settled on the baby when she was born, and which has been saved from the financial wreck, is the means of her education. Fifteen years later Thorne, who has been plodding along in the west, meeting with little success, wins $15,000 at faro in a desperate plunge one night. He has become tired of the woman he won by intrigue and his sudden prosperity turns his head. He arranges to go back to Wall Street to flirt with fortune, and he tells his wife he will not take her along, but will leave enough money for her to live on. She is horrified at the prospects of his desertion, and at the point of a revolver, demands his money. In a struggle which ensues, she is seriously wounded. Thorne leaves, believing his wife dead by the shot from her own hand. Back in Wall Street, Thorne electrifies other operators by his phenomenal rise to affluence, and he becomes the elegant man of wealth he aspired to be. Gail Collingwood, who has now grown to womanhood, is known under the name of Alice Gail, and employed as a reporter on the Evening News. She is sent to interview Thorne, who is now known as \"Edward North.\" They become very friendly and their acquaintance soon ripens into love. In due time their betrothal is announced. Out in the mining town Thorne's wife has recovered, and she resolves to come back to the scenes of her youth. She is seeking Thorne in the great city, when Gail, who is riding in an automobile loaned her by her fiancé, runs down her mother, a poor, ill-clad, wandering woman. The mother is slightly injured, and she recognizes her daughter. They plan to make \"North\" face his past. Gail sends word for \"North\" to come to her home, as she is in trouble. When he arrives he is brought face to face with his wife, whom he believed to be dead. \"North\" becomes frenzied from fear, as he thinks the sad faced woman is an apparition, and he flees from the house. The apparition continues to haunt him, and in a half-crazed mood he drives his automobile blindly through the streets, ending by running off a bridge when he is hurled to death.

The consensus of opinion is that the match is desirable in every way. The old Colonel says that in case of war the children of such a match would make fine soldiers. This frightens Margaret, as all her life she has had a dislike for war. Dr. Ardath is on his way to an important conference and gets started on his favorite subject, the heart. He tells those present of a wonderful new drug that has been found by a Russian student who used it to depress the action of his heart to get out of military service and who, taking an overdose, was killed. The story makes a strong impression on Margaret and she falls into a troubled sleep. A boy is born to Margaret. All through his childhood he shows signs of being a fighter, and when he grows up he wants to join the National Guard. Margaret is forced to give in and consents. Shortly afterward, Donald, the son, becomes engaged to Patricia Landon. His father is called to England on business and he is put in full charge of the firm. A few months afterward, a letter comes from the other side saying that his father had enlisted when the war broke out. Margaret takes the news seriously, and Dr. Ardath is sent for. The doctor leaves his case of medicines on the table and Margaret sees the cardiac depressant in it. The idea at once comes to her that it might be of use to her in case the government should draft her son, so she takes the vial. Then comes the news that the United States and Mexico are going to war. She at once makes use of the medicine and so affects the action of Donald's heart that he is rejected. The boy is heartbroken and goes to tell Patricia. He receives a cold reception and later the girl's mother argues with her until she agrees to break the engagement owing to Donald's poor health. Donald takes to drink. His mother is heartbroken, as she thinks that she is to blame for it all, and hesitates to tell the boy that Patricia has married another man. Then the news comes that Robert is wounded. Dr. Ardath returns and upon examining Donald, says that his heart is all right. They telephone the other doctor and from what he says, the doctor knows that some of the cardiac depressant must have been used. Donald, when he finds this out, rushes to accuse his mother. She goes to get the drug, but takes it herself instead. As Margaret comes to the head of the stairs she overhears Donald reading a telegram from Europe saying that her husband is dead. With that she falls over and, with a bump Margaret wakes from her terrible dream.

She refuses him and marries Aaron King and they welcome son Aaron King, Jr. John Willard, who does not approve of the intimacy between his sister Myra, and James Rutledge, provokes a quarrel with Rutledge. Thinking he has killed him, Willard goes West. A baby is born to Myra, who does not know that Rutledge has a wife. Mrs. Rutledge learns of it. Crazed with jealousy, she seeks Myra, throws acid in her face, marring her for life; then commits suicide. With Myra's permission, Rutledge takes the baby to raise with his son, James Rutlidge, Jr., and shares his wealth equally between them. Myra refuses his offers of money, and writes to John Willard, her brother, asking for help. In California, he holds up a mail stage to get money for her fare West. Willard is arrested. Myra, ignorant of this, goes to Graymont, California. Not finding her brother, she wanders into the mountains and to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Andres, who take her in. She is like a mother to Sybil, Andres' only child. Years pass. Aaron King, in financial difficulties and disgrace, dies. LaGrange, who has prospered, pays some of Mrs. King's debts and again asks her to marry him. She refuses, saying her life belongs to her boy. Mrs. King, sacrifices all to keep Aaron, her son, now a young man, in a Paris art school. Graduating with high honors, he receives word that his mother is ill, and rushes home in time to see her die. The Story: Twenty-five years have elapsed. Aaron King, Jr. leaves for the West. On the same train are Gertrude Taine; her husband Edward Taine, a wreck many years her senior; and Mrs. Taine's stepdaughter Louise Taine. They are met by James Rutledge, Jr. Myra, who now lives in Fairlands, recognizes Mrs. Taine and Rutledge. King becomes acquainted with LaGrange. Friendship springs up between the pair. King is commissioned to paint Mrs. Taine's portrait. He and LaGrange take a cottage next, to Sybil and Myra. Rutledge annoys Sybil with his attentions. King and LaGrange meet Sybil. Mrs. Taine becomes infatuated with King. John Willard (now known as John Marston) escapes from prison. He meets Rutledge, who befriends him and bides him in a mountain cabin. Mrs. Taine is pleased with the portrait. As King contrasts Sybil with Mrs. Taine, he sees the latter as a designing soul in a beautiful body. Refusing to let her have the portrait, he asks her to pose again. Thinking she has infatuated King, she consents. He also paints Sybil's portrait. Mrs. Taine gives a reception in honor of King and LaGrange. She tries to influence King by causing Sybil to play her violin as one of the paid performers. Mr. Taine collapses in the midst of a speech and is carried off, dying. Mrs. Taine, visiting King's studio, finds him absent. Sybil comes in. Mrs. Taine, bringing in the fact that Sybil was up in the mountains with Myra while LaGrange and King were on a camping trip in the mountains, convinces Sybil that the world thinks she is the artist's mistress.

      " Text: Claire Martin, niece of the wealthy Mrs. Taylor, suffers from loss of memory. Under the effect of this, Claire acts as an entirely different person. She wanders through the woods seeking shelter and food, and finally reaches a cabin temporarily occupied by a New York sportsman, who is fishing and hunting in the woods. For a week, Claire accepts the shelter from this sportsman whose love grows with each day's stay. Finally a strange rider passing the cabin asks for a drink, and Claire in her innocence shows her admiration for the new man, making him finally accept the temptation of her eyes to kiss her. At this moment Houghton, the sportsman, returns and bursts into the cabin. He drives out the stranger and then takes a knife and marks the woman so that she will always remember that her love must be for him alone. Houghton returns to New York. While walking down Fifth Avenue he sees in a photographer's showcase a picture which closely resembles the girl he thinks he lived with in the woods. He finds out who she is and decides to visit Great Neck and see if it is the same girl. Returning to his boat, Houghton looks at some pictures which he had taken of the girl and decides it must be she. He returns to the grounds of Mrs. Taylor's home and meeting Claire declares she is the woman who was with him at the cabin. Pushing back the dress from her shoulders, he points to the scar. She begs him to tell her what he knows about the scar, and he thinking she is bluffing, tells her to come to the houseboat and he will tell her. There Houghton proves that she must have been with him at the cabin and when he demands that she love him now as she did then and attempts to take her, she picks up a knife from the table and kills him. Kent, who has been over to the Yacht Club to a committee meeting, sees this when returning to his launch. He rushes to the boat and carries the fainting body of Claire home, gets her to her room and calls the doctor to see if he can help her. The doctor declares that the girl is guiltless of the crime, having gone back to her old personality, and they decide to make the case appear as one of suicide. When Kent is returning to the boat the following morning he finds there some pictures of her and her scarf, but when he himself is charged with the murder by the man who heard the quarrel, he is made to believe that Claire is innocent by Kent and the doctor, who point out to him the terrible weakness of circumstantial evidence. After Charlie goes, the doctor tells Kent that Claire needs care and attention and must be protected, and Kent in his great love takes her to his heart.\n",

      " Text: Sherlock Holmes, while out for a stroll with Dr. Watson, meets a beautiful woman. They are mutually attracted, but pass without recognition. Later Holmes is engaged by a noble family to recover papers involving the family in a scandal, and which are in the hands of a woman, whose sister was ruined by one of the members of the noble family. She is holding them in order to get revenge. Holmes discovers that the woman who holds these papers is the one that he had passed in the street, and to whom he was so singularly attracted. He tricks her out of the papers, but returns them to her, telling her that he believes that she will eventually give them to him of her own accord. He points out to her how much better it is to let the matter rest than to connect her own name with scandal in order to get revenge, not only on the man who caused her sister's unhappiness, but on the innocent members of his family. Holmes then goes to Watson's house, where he sends a note for the woman who holds the papers to meet him there. His cab driver, who is waiting outside, is the leader of the band of crooks.

The nobleman leaves satisfied and as Watson shows him to the door, Holmes slips his arms about the woman, and tells her of his love.\n",
