Saul Shilpick, Jr. is in love with Hortense, but she ignores him. Hortense suddenly quits her job and joins Comrade Harriet's \"uplifters.\" Harriet shares her home with Hortense, who is so infatuated with her new mission that she does not realize she has become an even more downtrodden laborer as a general servant to Harriet. Hortense believes she is in love with Larry Holden, a free-loader reformer who is actually already married and practices free love. Shilpick, Jr. disguises himself as a \"convert,\" rescues Hortense from the uplifters, and wins her love.\n",

      " Text: Mrs. Forbes, longtime housekeeper at the country mansion of disappointed, embittered aristocrat Mr. Evringham, who is almost a luxurious recluse, is worried: the household has been turned upside-down by the advent of the wife of Evringham's dead son Lawrence, who has arrived with her daughter Eloise. The mother is a schemer who, reduced to her last penny, is pulling every wire to induce wealthy young Dr. Ballard to marry Eloise. It looks as if she is going to succeed and the need for success is imperative because Mr. Evringham is set against his female dependents, whom he might expel from his home at any moment. Then word comes from another son, Harry Evringham, who writes that he and his wife must make a business trip abroad and he asks his father to take Jewel, the child he has never seen, into his home until they return in six weeks. Old Mr. Evringham reluctantly agrees to his son's request. He hates children and is gruff, unresponsive, and self-centered. The only reason he agrees to take the child is because his daughter-in-law, the widow, tries to get him to refuse. He hates this daughter-in-law; therefore takes Jewel in to spite her. Upon her arrival, Jewel meets with a very cool reception. She finds that, according to the Christian Science teachings with which she is familiar, that she has entered a household of hatred and discord. She puts the scriptures and Mrs. Eddy's teachings to practical use and proves to all scoffers that she has found and can demonstrate the truth. Jewel takes a strong liking to her bluff, stern, old grandfather and he finds his heart softening under her influence. She cures herself of a fever which she says came o because a shadow of hatred passed over her for the house's inmates. She wins the heart of the grim housekeeper when she redeems her drunkard son from the grip of the liquor demon, she converts Eloise to the truth of Divine Science, and she proves to everyone that Science can win in spite of all. She reaps a harvest of good from a bleak, barren soil, uniting the strained and jarring household by chain after chain of love.\n",

      " Text: Phyllis Clyne, a manikin in a modiste's shop in London, learns that a gentleman known as the Honorable Billy has gone broke. Having saved up some money and being anxious to get into society, Phyllis goes to the Hon. William and offers him quite a neat sum if he will pretend that she is engaged to him. Billy consents, with the result that he falls in love with her. Phyllis, in spite of Billy's warning, persists in running about with Lord Sheldon, an elderly nobleman with a spicy reputation. Just as Billy has made up his mind that he cannot live without Phyllis, he is led to suppose that she has eloped with Sheldon.

      " Text: Naomi, a girl of the studios in New York's artist quarter, is possessed of a superabundance of vitality and a desire for continuous frolic and adventure. One night, at a gay party, Naomi's effervescent spirits deceive one of the men into thinking that she is far more unconventional than she herself has any idea of being. His companions tell him that she is not the sort of girl he thinks she is, but he insists that he can prove that she is; he even makes a wager to that effect. He tricks Naomi, who is really quite unsophisticated, accompanying him to a hotel of questionable repute, where the two, innocent of any wrongdoing, are captured in a police raid, and Naomi has an unpleasant experience in the night court. Friends come to her aid and she is released. Not long after this, Frederic Harmon, a broker, comes into her life. The two fall in love and are married; the birth of a baby completes Naomi's character and she cares only for her child, her husband, and her home. The husband, however, does not settle down to home life. He is still much inclined to the gaieties of the set in which he had become acquainted with Naomi, and when she refuses to take further part in the revels of the Bohemian crowd, he goes forth by himself and soon meets Helen Carew, a woman with a past and without a conscience, who fascinates him partly for her amusement and partly for mercenary reasons. Eventually Harmon's infatuation for the other woman becomes known to Naomi. She is heartbroken, particularly when Harmon asks her to divorce him so he can marry Helen. This she refuses to do. Helen, anxious to get the man entirely into her clutches, enters into a plot with a crooked detective whereby Naomi is to be caught in a compromising situation, thus giving her husband grounds for divorce from her. The detective picks up a convict just out of Sing Sing and by means of a decoy message Naomi is induced to go to a hotel room where the man from Sing Sing is waiting for her. Once the two are in the room together it is raided by newspaper reporters and a photographer, and a flashlight of Naomi in the arms of the convict is obtained. The husband brings suit for divorce, offering as evidence the stories of the witnesses at the raid and the flashlight photograph. He also asks custody of the child. Naomi startles the judge and spectators when she declares that she should be allowed to keep the child, because Harmon is not its father. The judge, however, suspects that Naomi is sacrificing her reputation in order to keep her baby, and calling her into his private office, he gets the truth from her. Meantime there has been an unexpected development in the affairs of Helen. The man from Sing Sing had been her lover before he went to prison, and she is unpleasantly surprised when the detective's use of him brings him again into her life. The ex-convict is in Helen's rooms, trying to renew their old association when Harmon comes to see her. Helen hastily hides the jailbird, but while she is talking to Harmon the convict comes out and tells Harmon of the woman's past and his connection with it. Horrified at the revelation of Helen's true character, Harmon goes out of her life at once and forever, but in the course of time succeeds in winning his way back into his home.\n",

      " Text: In the House of Tears, there lived Robert Collingwood, his wife, Alice Collingwood, and their baby girl, Gail. In the courts Robert has been granted a decree of divorce and the custody of little Gail, upon evidence that Mrs. Collingwood has been found in a compromising situation with Henry Thorne, and her subsequent admissions. Once free, Mrs. Collingwood openly accepts the attention of Thorne, and they soon marry and go west to live. Thorne takes up the life of a prospector in a mining community, and his consistent failure proves a source of discouragement to him and unhappiness to the woman. Collingwood, his mind upset by domestic troubles, loses his fortune in Wall Street manipulation, and becomes a raving maniac. He drives his employees out of the office, and then goes to his home intending to kill his little daughter. In a chase up a staircase, he falls and is killed. An annuity he had settled on the baby when she was born, and which has been saved from the financial wreck, is the means of her education. Fifteen years later Thorne, who has been plodding along in the west, meeting with little success, wins $15,000 at faro in a desperate plunge one night. He has become tired of the woman he won by intrigue and his sudden prosperity turns his head. He arranges to go back to Wall Street to flirt with fortune, and he tells his wife he will not take her along, but will leave enough money for her to live on. She is horrified at the prospects of his desertion, and at the point of a revolver, demands his money. In a struggle which ensues, she is seriously wounded. Thorne leaves, believing his wife dead by the shot from her own hand. Back in Wall Street, Thorne electrifies other operators by his phenomenal rise to affluence, and he becomes the elegant man of wealth he aspired to be. Gail Collingwood, who has now grown to womanhood, is known under the name of Alice Gail, and employed as a reporter on the Evening News. She is sent to interview Thorne, who is now known as \"Edward North.\" They become very friendly and their acquaintance soon ripens into love. In due time their betrothal is announced. Out in the mining town Thorne's wife has recovered, and she resolves to come back to the scenes of her youth. She is seeking Thorne in the great city, when Gail, who is riding in an automobile loaned her by her fiancé, runs down her mother, a poor, ill-clad, wandering woman. The mother is slightly injured, and she recognizes her daughter. They plan to make \"North\" face his past. Gail sends word for \"North\" to come to her home, as she is in trouble. When he arrives he is brought face to face with his wife, whom he believed to be dead. \"North\" becomes frenzied from fear, as he thinks the sad faced woman is an apparition, and he flees from the house. The apparition continues to haunt him, and in a half-crazed mood he drives his automobile blindly through the streets, ending by running off a bridge when he is hurled to death. Mother and daughter, re-united, then seek a happier existence.\n",

      " Text: Claire Martin, niece of the wealthy Mrs. Taylor, suffers from loss of memory. Under the effect of this, Claire acts as an entirely different person. She wanders through the woods seeking shelter and food, and finally reaches a cabin temporarily occupied by a New York sportsman, who is fishing and hunting in the woods. For a week, Claire accepts the shelter from this sportsman whose love grows with each day's stay. Finally a strange rider passing the cabin asks for a drink, and Claire in her innocence shows her admiration for the new man, making him finally accept the temptation of her eyes to kiss her. At this moment Houghton, the sportsman, returns and bursts into the cabin. He drives out the stranger and then takes a knife and marks the woman so that she will always remember that her love must be for him alone. Houghton returns to New York. While walking down Fifth Avenue he sees in a photographer's showcase a picture which closely resembles the girl he thinks he lived with in the woods. He finds out who she is and decides to visit Great Neck and see if it is the same girl. Returning to his boat, Houghton looks at some pictures which he had taken of the girl and decides it must be she. He returns to the grounds of Mrs. Taylor's home and meeting Claire declares she is the woman who was with him at the cabin. Pushing back the dress from her shoulders, he points to the scar. She begs him to tell her what he knows about the scar, and he thinking she is bluffing, tells her to come to the houseboat and he will tell her. There Houghton proves that she must have been with him at the cabin and when he demands that she love him now as she did then and attempts to take her, she picks up a knife from the table and kills him. Kent, who has been over to the Yacht Club to a committee meeting, sees this when returning to his launch. He rushes to the boat and carries the fainting body of Claire home, gets her to her room and calls the doctor to see if he can help her. The doctor declares that the girl is guiltless of the crime, having gone back to her old personality, and they decide to make the case appear as one of suicide. When Kent is returning to the boat the following morning he finds there some pictures of her and her scarf, but when he himself is charged with the murder by the man who heard the quarrel, he is made to believe that Claire is innocent by Kent and the doctor, who point out to him the terrible weakness of circumstantial evidence. After Charlie goes, the doctor tells Kent that Claire needs care and attention and must be protected, and Kent in his great love takes her to his heart.\n",

He tricks her out of the papers, but returns them to her, telling her that he believes that she will eventually give them to him of her own accord.
