She does nothing to correct the report that she has been killed in a train wreck, and so Richard, believing himself to be a widower, marries Barbara. After a few months, Isabel longs to see her children and so, disguising herself, gets a job as their governess. Then, when her son becomes ill and calls out for his mother, Isabel throws off her disguise and goes to comfort him, but he dies in her arms. Discovering Isabel with the boy, Richard immediately forgives her for having left him and the children, but Isabel cannot forgive herself, and soon dies of grief.',\n",

Carlo Sonino, also a member of the company, falls in love with Ethel and warns her against becoming infatuated with the amorous singer. Paurel becomes enchanted with Ethel, arousing the jealousy of the company's prima donna, Sabotini. When, after the first act, Ethel hears that Paurel has suffered an attack of the throat, she rushes backstage. Carlo, urged by Sabotini, follows and makes a scene, whereupon Ethel indignantly announces her engagement to Paurel. Paurel is unable to perform in the second act, and Carlo, taking his place, is vaulted to stardom. After Paurel is diagnosed as never being able to sing again, Bianca, a retired singer and Paurel's first love, reveals that Carlo is their son and pleads with the singer to give up Ethel for the boy's sake. After much soul-searching, Paurel refutes his selfish ways and agrees, thus freeing Ethel from her pledge to marry him.\",\n",

She does nothing to correct the report that she has been killed in a train wreck, and so Richard, believing himself to be a widower, marries Barbara. After a few months, Isabel longs to see her children and so, disguising herself, gets a job as their governess. Then, when her son becomes ill and calls out for his mother, Isabel throws off her disguise and goes to comfort him, but he dies in her arms. Discovering Isabel with the boy, Richard immediately forgives her for having left him and the children, but Isabel cannot forgive herself, and soon dies of grief.'},\n",

Carlo Sonino, also a member of the company, falls in love with Ethel and warns her against becoming infatuated with the amorous singer. Paurel becomes enchanted with Ethel, arousing the jealousy of the company's prima donna, Sabotini. When, after the first act, Ethel hears that Paurel has suffered an attack of the throat, she rushes backstage. Carlo, urged by Sabotini, follows and makes a scene, whereupon Ethel indignantly announces her engagement to Paurel. Paurel is unable to perform in the second act, and Carlo, taking his place, is vaulted to stardom. After Paurel is diagnosed as never being able to sing again, Bianca, a retired singer and Paurel's first love, reveals that Carlo is their son and pleads with the singer to give up Ethel for the boy's sake. After much soul-searching, Paurel refutes his selfish ways and agrees, thus freeing Ethel from her pledge to marry him.\"},\n",

After having her modiste make silk overalls which Genevieve models on Russian ballet attire, she arrives at the Hubbard ranch in New York State with her chauffeur, maid, and pet dog, to be a \"farmerette.\" While Genevieve finds the chores difficult and the other girls unfriendly, Bobbie, the youngest Hubbard, discovers officer training camp to be equally discouraging. Although he is tempted to desert, Bobbie only leaves for one night to see his home again. He finds Genevieve crying in a potato patch, and together they resolve to do their patriotic duty. When a prying neighbor, seeing them together, tells the Hubbards that Genevieve was with a soldier, Genevieve remains silent about Bobbie\\'s identity, and is banished from the ranch. After Bobbie gets a furlough and explains matters, the Hubbards apologize to Genevieve. Bobby proposes, and they plan to marry when he returns from \"over there.\"'}]"
